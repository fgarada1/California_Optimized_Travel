# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet every Wednesday from 7pm to 9pm, give or take. We will be using Discord to attend these meetings. We will alternate recording minutes.


2. **Assistance** 
 If a teammate needs assistance, they can reach out to the other teammates through a communication channel that we have set up on Discord. The expected response time should be by the end of the day, or as soon as possible after the time after the message has been received. The second point of contact will be the mentor, as well the project channel on the cs225 discord server.


3. **Respect** 
 In order to make sure that each team member has a fair amount of contribution throughout the project, and that each team member has a chance to bring into discussion their own ideas, we will start each meeting by discussing progress on the previous week's goals, the goals for the coming week, and ask if each teammate feels that the project is coming along in a direction that they are satisfied with and address bottlenecks. We will also use this time to make adjustments to our current plans as necessary, and adjust our long term goals as needed.


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will assign workload each week by evaluating each othersâ€™ schedules, and come to a decision on which parts of the project that each team member should contribute to and which parts of the project each team member should expect to have completed by the end of the week.
We will address unexpected complications/unforeseen work by trying to accomplish goals ahead of time, so that when the fixed and flexible deadlines arrive, we can reevaluate which goals were not met and make new and revised goals as necessary, based on the time that we have remaining. We will do our best to communicate with our team if something arises that causes a teammate to be behind on their goals, so that another team member can help cover the absence of work, with the expectation that they will do the same for them if the occasion arises. If this becomes a larger issue, we will reevaluate our team goals and have a meeting with our team project manager.


5. **Time Commitment** 
We expect each team member to contribute roughly the same amount of time as they would for an mp each week, or about 2 hours minimum if the task is especially long for that week. To avoid scheduling more work than what one single team member can accomplish in a week, we will communicate as a team about prior time commitments every week, so that each team member can work towards the goal for the week, as they are able to. We will address new/unexpected time commitments by communicating through Discord, so that other team members may be able to help when they are available.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will solve all team issues through proper communication and discussion. If a team member is unable to complete their tasks, then depending on the reason, we will either further split the task amongst the team, or give additional support as needed. If members are habitually late due to conflicting schedules, then we will reschedule the meeting to a more convenient time.
